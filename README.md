# Chronos

Chronos is a time dilation simulation project that demonstrates how time behaves differently under relativistic conditions such as high velocity or strong gravitational fields.

The project focuses on visualizing and calculating time dilation using fundamental physics formulas in a simple and intuitive way.

## Features
- Simulates relativistic time dilation
- Compares proper time vs observed time
- Supports velocity-based time dilation
- Easy-to-understand calculations
- Designed for learning and experimentation

## Physics Behind It
Chronos uses Einstein’s time dilation formula: 
![TIME DILATION FORMULA](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?t%27%20=%20\frac{t}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}})
Where:
- **t** = proper time (time at rest)
- **t′** = dilated time (observed time)
- **v** = relative velocity
- **c** = speed of light

![GRAVITATIONAL TIME DILATION](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?t'%20=%20t\sqrt{1-\frac{2GM}{rc^2}})

Where:
- **t** = proper time far from the gravitational field
- **t′** = time measured near a massive object
- **G** = gravitational constant
- **M** = mass of the object
- **r** = radial distance from the center of mass
- **c** = speed of light

Chronos allows comparison of how time flows differently due to:
- High relative velocities
- Strong gravitational fields

This makes the simulation useful for educational and conceptual understanding of relativistic time effects.



## Example
It shows how time passes for someone at rest, and how much slower it gets as someone moves at the speed close to speed of light

# Purpose
This project is built for:
- Understanding relativistic time dilation
- Educational demonstration
- Physics and simulation experimentation
