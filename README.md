# Chronos

Chronos is a time dilation simulation project that demonstrates how time behaves differently under relativistic conditions such as high velocity or strong gravitational fields.

The project focuses on visualizing and calculating time dilation using fundamental physics formulas in a simple and intuitive way.

## Features
- Simulates relativistic time dilation
- Compares proper time vs observed time
- Supports velocity-based time dilation
- Easy-to-understand calculations
- Designed for learning and experimentation

## Physics Behind It
Chronos uses Einstein’s time dilation formula:

## Example
It shows how time passes for someone at rest, and how much slower it gets as someone moves at the speed close to speed of light

# Purpose
This project is built for:
- Understanding relativistic time dilation
- Educational demonstration
- Physics and simulation experimentation
